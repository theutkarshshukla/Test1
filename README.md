# Test1
We are creating 3D models of 2D maps using ai,  providing users with immersive virtual reality (VR) tours and 3d gammified simulation of properties they would like to buy or rent . The process involves the AI recognizing a 2D map and area, and setting a marker for each location. This allows the marker-based augmented reality (AR) to place objects accurately, converting the 2D model into a 3D model. By using the 3D model generated by the AI, users can walk through their homes via the help of a 3D avatar, interacting with objects in the virtual environment. They can purchase furniture and other equipment for their homes directly via the click of a virtual button, with a purchase window opening in the virtual environment. Users can swap these elements, such as different types of faucets in a sink, to view how they would look in VR (or simulation) and make informed purchase decisions based on this experience. 

Our intend is to use ai with help of "ARcore SDK" to identify various elements on A map of property provided by user or building's owner to place walls and doors at location identified with help of "Unity" on map, thus converting any 2d map into a 3d model. This 3d model can immediately be accessed by user via AR through our app.
We are building our app using "unity" (to implement AR core SDK) and "Flutter" (to give a fluid and smooth user experience).
This feature is to build a fast user base . As we intend to make this feature free.
