We are creating 3D models of 2D maps using ai,  providing users with immersive virtual reality (VR) tours and 3d gammified simulation of properties they would like to buy or rent . The process involves the AI recognizing a 2D map and area, and setting a marker for each location. This allows the marker-based augmented reality (AR) to place objects accurately, converting the 2D model into a 3D model. By using the 3D model generated by the AI, users can walk through their homes via the help of a 3D avatar, interacting with objects in the virtual environment. They can purchase furniture and other equipment for their homes directly via the click of a virtual button, with a purchase window opening in the virtual environment. Users can swap these elements, such as different types of faucets in a sink, to view how they would look in VR (or simulation) and make informed purchase decisions based on this experience.
